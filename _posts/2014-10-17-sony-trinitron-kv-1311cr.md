In October 2014, I bought an extremely rare [RGB Sony Trinitron KV-1311CR](https://archive.today/SOIaE) from eBay at the great price of $40+13 shipping. 

RGB CRT monitors are the best way to experience Amigas, Apple ][GS, and NES/SNES. I planned to use this on an Apple ][GS or at least via an emulated SNES through a Raspberry Pi.

The **Sony Trinitron KV-1311CR** in particular has an Analog RGB port for 15hz input from an Amiga or Apple ][gs. The Raspberry Pi [seems to work great on it.](http://raspberrypinovice.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/finish.png) It was showcased on [LGR's Amiga review.](http://youtu.be/XVZrL4k1los?t=6m7s)  It also came with the elusive [IDC-34 Analog RGB ports](https://docs.sony.com/release/KV1311CR.PDF) that the ][GS and Amiga required; just in case I ever wanted [to use them in full color in the future.](http://imgur.com/a/QY9NY)

Though the cables are hard to find (even for the [Lazy Game Reviewer](http://youtu.be/XVZrL4k1los?t=6m7s)), and probably have to be custom made. [Redmond Cable](http://redcab.com) is a good place to [get one](http://mirrors.apple2.org.za/apple.cabi.net/FAQs.and.INFO/VIDEO.MISC.INFO/IIgs.Compat.monitors.txt)) of these cables built.

[On Page 3.2 of this guide,](http://www.tinaja.com/glib/hackar1.pdf) there is a [schematic](http://www.textfiles.com/magazines/ZNET/0049.txt) showing exactly how to connect it's Analog RGB port to a ][GS. This monitor doesn't work well with the 80 character Apple ][, though; but that's why I kept the Apple ][ green screen monitor.


I obtained this specific model since it was a nice fit with a gutted IBM Personal Wheelwriter 2 (with keyboard wired to USB), which I was using for an Accurate Emulation Arcade.

## Bad Packaging

Unfortunately, when I recieved the Trinitron, I discovered that the tube was smashed in and wouldn't even turn on, since it was poorly packed and was delivered by rabid gorillas. 

That is a shame. It would have looked quite nice alongside the Accurate Emulation Arcade with Wheelwriter case that I was putting together.

Thankfully, the seller absorbed the monetary cost and made an insurance claim to FedEx (insured up to $100), but I might never come across one of these rare TVs ever again, let alone at a decent price.

Please pack your CRTs in sturdy wooden crates with tons of bubble wrap, not just a cardboard box with a couple of packaging peanuts.
