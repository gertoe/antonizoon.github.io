One of the most important things about shipping a PCB board is to keep it safe from static: Especially when much of the packing material is static-prone plastic bubble wrap.

Some of the motherboards I purchased (T60 Intel Motherboards) came with handy 3M reusable anti-static bags. However, some didn't, and when I sold off the T60p ATI GPU motherboards (which aren't supported by Libreboot), I had to wrap them in something else.

I had two reusable hard drive anti-static bags, but these were long and rectangular, while the motherboards were square. 

So what I did was, I sliced one side of the bags open, and stuffed the motherboard in the pocket. However, one end of the motherboard ended up exposed.

I grabbed another bag and sliced it open as well. This time, this bag was a bit long for the motherboard. So I cut off the excess, and reused it to wrap the protruding sides of both motherboards. Eventually, I patched together a full Anti-static solution. Tape down all open ends and we're good to go.

Improvised packaging not only saves money, it's good for the environment. 

Though above all, **make sure that the package is safe and sturdy**. All shipping companies throw their packages, so poor backing could leave the buyer with a pile of rubble.
