This guide aims to provide fellow system administrators with a guide to setting up Mediawiki with the most efficient configuration possible. Special technologies such as HHVM and Nginx are used here. The official Mediawiki guide does provide some hints as to how to use them, but does not always provide the complete information that a novice administrator needs to scale up their wiki.
