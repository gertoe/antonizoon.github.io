A list of the many projects that I've been part of over my lifetime.

Assorted Projects
---------------

Stuff I do as a hobby in my spare time.

Bibliotheca Anonoma
-------------------

Projects I've worked on as part of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

### 2015

* **2015-03-21**: [Yotsuba Society Website - Migrating to Drupal From Jekyll](http://blog.bibanon.org/basc/migrating-to-jekyll-from-drupal/) - The Bibliotheca Anonoma has put together a brand new, Jekyll (and Minimal Mistakes)-based [website for the Yotsuba Society.](http://yotsubasociety.github.io) This beats the rotting Drupal 7.x CMS it used to have, which got spam sites injected inside like barnacles on a ship's hull.
  * This project took a lot of effort, since I had to keep all the URLs consistent to fend off link rot. I even had to fix the `jekyll-import` script [by sending a pull request to the devs](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import/pull/192), because it was spitting out binary gunk instead of sweet Unicode strings.
* **2015-01-25**: [Moot's Final 4chan Q&A Transcript](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki/Moot%27s-Final-4chan-Q%26A-Transcript) *(ongoing)* - A project to transcribe Moot's 8-hour ramblings, and extract the true poignant meaning of his words. Moot is the most important primary source for early 4chan history, and behind-the-scenes administration info.

BASLQC
------

Projects I've worked on as part of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma Software Liquidation Commission.](https://github.com/BASLQC)

### 2015

* [BASLQC VNDS Wiki](https://github.com/BASLQC/vnds/wiki) - Unfortunately, it looks like the VNDS Digital Haze forums have collapsed entirely, and the Wiki is in a percarious state (with the dropbox links lost). I am liquidating what I can.
