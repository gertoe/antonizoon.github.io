My reflections on how the English 202C class went and how it will improve my writing skills for my work.

The course objectives of ENGL 202C was to conduct Technical Writing: to build documents that would help users fulfill their goals while using a product, conducting their work, or understanding a concept. The course introduced various types of technical writing assignments from guides to research papers to instruction pamphlets, which exposed me to concepts about how these documents that people deal with every day are made and used.

The projects I have included in my portfolio are (TBA)

Since I will be conducting research projects and making technical manuals for my users, this will be crucial in my future work prospects. As a researcher, I would be constantly writing research papers to convey my findings to the scientific community, and using charts to better understand the meaning of the data. As a programmer, making better documentation that show how to conduct a certain process is crucial to helping users or developers utilize my programs or libraries.

Thus, in this portfolio I put together a set of items that would convey the best of what I learned and made in this course to a prospective employer, mainly all the items that would be relevant to a research or programming position.

This portfolio is constructed using Github Pages with the Jekyll static site engine. Static Site engines simply use Markdown syntax instead of WYSIWYG visual editing. I have experience using this system, and I find other engines such as Wordpress to be unnecessarily complex in programming.
