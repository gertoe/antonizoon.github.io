_My reflections on how the English 202C class went and how it will improve my writing skills for my work._

The course objectives of ENGL 202C was to conduct Technical Writing: to build documents that would help users fulfill their goals while using a product, conducting their work, or understanding a concept. The course introduced various types of technical writing assignments from guides to research papers to instruction pamphlets, which exposed me to concepts about how these documents that people deal with every day are made and used.

My career goals involve research at the graduate level at Penn State, and then work likely as either a programmer or Linux system administrator. Soon, I will become a Linux System Administrator at the Federal Reserve as part of a summer internship, and it will involve informing my colleagues of issues, resolving them on my own, and documenting what I've done so that my successor will be able to continue running hte system well.

In the course of my work, I will be making many research papers and technical manuals. As a researcher, I would be constantly writing research papers to convey my findings to the scientific community, and using charts to better understand the meaning of the data. As a programmer, making better documentation that show how to conduct a certain process is crucial to helping users or developers utilize my programs or libraries.

Thus, the projects I have included in my portfolio are (TBA)

Thus, in this portfolio I put together a set of items that would convey the best of what I learned and made in this course to a prospective employer, mainly all the items that would be relevant to a research or programming position. I hope that visitors looking for my technical manuals will be adequately informed enough to succeed in their activities, and that employers will come away with the impression that I am a competent candidate for a programming or system administration position.

This portfolio is constructed using Github Pages with the Jekyll static site engine. Static Site engines simply use Markdown syntax instead of WYSIWYG visual editing. I have experience using this system, and I find other engines such as Wordpress to be unnecessarily complex in programming, even though they might look nice and be easy to work with. The choice of my website engine will also have just a bit of meaning to fellow programmers, that I am someone that likes to keep things simple and build from scratch rather than accept common, clunky systems that look great but don't work so great after some time.
