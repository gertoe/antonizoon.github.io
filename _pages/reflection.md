_My reflections on how the English 202C class went and how it will improve my writing skills for my work._

The course objectives of ENGL 202C was to conduct Technical Writing: to build documents that would help users fulfill their goals while using a product, conducting their work, or understanding a concept. The course introduced various types of technical writing assignments from guides to research papers to instruction pamphlets, which exposed me to concepts about how these documents that people deal with every day are made and used. 

During this course, I realized how my writing would affect how users reacted or worked, through the peer reviews which gave me quick feedback. Also, items such as manuals should provide a way for users to quickly jump to the information they need, since users are unlikely to read every element of the manual at once. These are crucial skills that will serve me well when I write documentation for my projects.

My career goals involve research at the graduate level at Penn State, and then work likely as either a programmer or Linux system administrator. Soon, I will become a Linux System Administrator at the Federal Reserve as part of a summer internship, and it will involve informing my colleagues of issues, resolving them on my own, and documenting what I've done so that my successor will be able to continue running the system well.

In the course of my work, I will be making many research papers and technical manuals. As a researcher, I would be constantly writing research papers to convey my findings to the scientific community, and using charts to better understand the meaning of the data. As a programmer, making better documentation that show how to conduct a certain process is crucial to helping users or developers utilize my programs or libraries.

Thus, in this portfolio I put together a set of items that would convey the best of what I learned and made in this course to a prospective employer, mainly all the items that would be relevant to a research or programming position. I hope that visitors looking for my technical manuals will be adequately informed enough to succeed in their activities, and that employers will come away with the impression that I am a competent candidate for a programming or system administration position. 

First, I included my Job Application Package: specifically, the resume I wrote. I attached the resume as an employer would have seen it in it's original form to the website as a Box embedded document, though a cover letter is not included (as the ePortfolio is not a letter). The resume is a crucial part of my ePortfolio, since even if I already gave the employer my resume, they might want to revisit it quickly.  Creating my resume during the course was a helpful experience, since it pushed me to consider how a resume would be seen by other people. I already had a resume, but the skills learned in this course allowed me to improve the formatting and squeeze more relevant information in. During the peer reviews of the resume, I looked at other user's design and found some things that could be improved, and my partner did the same for mine.

Next, I added my Instruction Set. This was a type of assignment that felt natural to me and even became useful afterwards on my own website. I learned more deeply about how to describe the steps of a system, and saw what happened when directions were not clear in the Lego activity. As a result, not only did I make a good assignment, I also made a useful guide that will help me and others out in putting together their wiki systems.

I learned the basics of website design in the course, which would have helped others who were new to web design, but as an intermediate developer I took a different path. This portfolio is constructed using Github Pages with the Jekyll static site engine. Static Site engines simply use Markdown syntax instead of WYSIWYG visual editing. I have experience using this system, and I find other engines such as Wordpress to be unnecessarily complex in programming, even though they might look nice and be easy to work with. The choice of my website engine will also have just a bit of meaning to fellow programmers, that I am someone that likes to keep things simple and build from scratch rather than accept common, clunky systems that look great but don't work so great after some time.
