I'm **Lawrence Wu** (Antonizoon), a renegade archivist, self-taught programmer, and founder of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

I was born to my Taiwanese American parents in the suburban desert of the Inland Empire (on the outskirts of Los Angeles, California). 

I'm currently enrolled as an undergraduate at [Penn State University](http://psu.edu), and majoring in [Information Science and Technology](http://ist.psu.edu) (IST).

I spend my time building [amazing projects](../projects/), working on groundbreaking research, and working for the [Bibliotheca Anonoma.](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

If you have any questions about a blog post, my projects, [The Bibliotheca Anonoma](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki), or anything else, just ask! The best way to contact me is via email, at <lvw5264@psu.edu>. 

Also, if you just happen to be around at Penn State University, I'd be happy to meet up with you.
