I'm **Lawrence Wu** (Antonizoon), a renegade archivist, self-taught programmer, and founder of the [Bibliotheca Anonoma](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

I was born to my Taiwanese American parents in the suburban desert of the Inland Empire (on the outskirts of Los Angeles, California). Since my high school years, I have been a skilled programmer with Python and Java and had strong experience managing Linux servers for myself and others. 

To further my programming skills, I enrolled as an undergraduate at [Penn State University](http://psu.edu) to major in [Information Science and Technology](http://ist.psu.edu) (IST) and join an undergraduate research program to apply them. At Penn State, I've worked on software research projects, built a promising startup with a fellow student, managed Linux servers for a professor, and developed some unique electronic equipment. 

I've also entered into the *Integrated Undergraduate/Graduate Program*, which will provide me with both a Bachelor's and Master's Degree by May 2018.

I spend my time building [amazing projects](../projects/), working on groundbreaking research, building some servers and backends for tech startups, and working for the [Bibliotheca Anonoma.](https://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki).

If you have any questions about a blog post, my projects, [The Bibliotheca Anonoma](http://github.com/bibanon/bibanon/wiki), or anything else, just ask! The best way to contact me is via email, at <lvw5264@psu.edu>. 

Also, if you just happen to be around at Penn State University, I'd be happy to meet up with you.
